This Seascapes app was designed to help nodes in the [MarineBON.org](https://marinebon.org) network extract Seascape data, especially across [NOAA Sanctuaries](https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov), for comparison with biological data from eDNA, sound, telemetry and other observational data to evaluate how dynamic water masses relate to ecosystem function. 

Seascapes are dynamic classifications of sea surface properties derived from satellite imagery by [Maria Kavanaugh](https://ceoas.oregonstate.edu/people/maria-kavanaugh) et al. This app was designed using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and the [`seascapeR`](https://marinebon.org/seascapeR) package in the R programming language.
